# Healthy Diet Planner

## "I just want to survive through university"

An example of text with **bold** and *italic* fonts.  
Note that the IntelliJ markdown previewer doesn't seem to render 
the bold and italic fonts correctly but they will appear correctly on GitHub.

### What will the application do?

Major features of the application:
- *Recommends* daily meal plan with menus from selected food places based on the desired calories intake and budget
- *Recommends* daily meal plan with menus from selected food places for special cases with dietary restrictions
- *Excludes* specific menus from the plan
- *Saves* daily meal plans to construct customized weekly/monthly meal plan

###Who will use it?
My program is targeted towards *UBC students*, 
especially those who live in the student residents without proper cooking equipment.

###Why is this project of interest to you?
As a student living in a first year residence without kitchen, 
I personally have experienced significant hardships managing a healthy diet. 

Not only the nutrition was in concern, but also the budget I had for food is limited, 
leading to unhealthier diet, since cheaper foods usually are not as healthy as high quality foods. 

I found many fellow university students are experiencing similar needs to **balance nutrition and cost**, 
but failing to make a time themselves to invest into it and build a customized meal plan.

Therefore, I decided to build an application that helps 
to minimize the time taken to build a customizable meal plan 
so more students like myself can achieve healthier lifestyle.
